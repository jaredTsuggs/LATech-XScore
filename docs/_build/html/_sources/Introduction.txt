Introduction
************

XScore is the scoring server for Cyber Storm, a network security
competition in which teams will attempt to *hack* each others
networks.  Teams are to provide a number of network services that 
they will be expected to maintain despite attacks from opposing teams.
The effectiveness of these attacks will be the determining factor in 
deciding the winner of the competition.

The XScore system provides the following services:

* Checking the status of various network services provided by teams.
* Maintaining a running score of throughout the competition.
* Providing an administrative interface to manage competition related events.


Goal
====

The goal of this project is to provide a framework for not only Cyber Storm, but also
for future network security competitions.  It is hoped that the infrastructure provided 
by XScore will be useful and provide a solid foundation upon which Louisiana Tech, as well
as other institutions, can use to host similiar competitions
